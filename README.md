## Rail Relocation Mod ##  

* This mod is designed to move the linear rails from the front of the 2040 extrusions to the outside. Having the linear rails on the side makes installing the X 2020 considerably easier. Make sure you line up the linear rails with the 2020 jig from the original download.  

* The original X 2020 was 420mm. This modification will require a 450mm 2020 for the X. You can go longer but the new 2020 needs to be at least 30mm longer. There's 7 parts you'll need to print. View the pictures, the replacement parts are in green. You should be able to reuse the original parts. You'll also need a longer belt.  

## AM8 MGN CoreXY X Carriage ##  
* I've modified the X carriage from the CoreXY to work with the AM8 MGN mod. You'll need to print the 7 parts from my mod that moves the linear rails to the outsides of 2040 and all 9 parts for the X carriage. This mod also moves the X endstop from the top of the 2020 to be recessed on the inside of the X Carriage Rear plate. It might not be necessary so you make the choice.
